                <!-- your work experience -->
                <h3><b>Picking Blueberries</b></h3>
                <p>
                        Funk's Blueberries | 1980 - Present
                </p>
                <p>
                       Working at Funk's Blueberries was my very first paying job. The farm is open 4 weeks in summer and that's when I do most of my working. I also help do some preperation all year round. All the jobes I've done on the farm are:
                <ul>
                        <li>Picking Blueberries</li>
                        <li>Sorting Blueberries</li>
                        <li>Making box's for the Blueberries</li>
                        <li>Raking Sawdust</li>
                        <li>Chopping and moving lumber</li>
                        <li>Mice Poisoning</li>
                        <li>Cleaning irrigation</li>
                        <li>Redoing Wires</li>
                        <li>Weeding</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <h3><b>Lifeguarding</b></h3>
                <p>First things first, I have no accual work experience lifeguarding but I've completed all the required courses. All I need to do is to turn 16. All required courses are:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Bronze Medallion with Emergency First Aid & CPR</li>
                        <li>Bronze Cross</li>
                        <li>Standard First Aid</li>
                        <li>National Lifeguard Pool Course(NL)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lifeguarding requires many qualities that make a good worker. ALl these skills are very useful for becoming an ENGINEER. Here are 5 of the main ones:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>Determination</i>: Lifeguards work hard and are determined to do the right thing.</li>
                    <li><i>Passion</i>: Lifeguards are passionate about their work.</li>
                    <li><i>Strong communication abilities</i>: Essential for any lifeguard.</li>
                    <li><i>Quick decision-making and emergency response</i>: Illustrate readiness to handle challenges.</li>
                    <li><i>Leadership and teamwork</i>: Building confidence and working as part of a team.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2><u>Insparation</u></h2>
                <p>The insparation I got to become an engineer was from my dad. He is a mechanical engineer who is working on designing a heart catheter that helps fix irregular heart beats. His product is helping people live and have a normal life. And that's what I want to do. For take your kid to work day I went to my dad's work, there they have a mini program for us students. I got to disect a pig heart; it was fun. I really enjoyed my experience and want to become an engineer just like my dad.
