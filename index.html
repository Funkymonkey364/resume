                <ul>
                        <li>Picking Blueberries</li>
                        <li>Sorting Blueberries</li>

                <h3><b>Lifeguarding</b></h3>
                <p>First things first, I have no accual work experience lifeguarding but I've completed all the required courses. All I need to do is to turn 16. All required courses are:</p>
